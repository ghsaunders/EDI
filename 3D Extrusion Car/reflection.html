<p><i>The assignment for this project was to utilize a multi-step designing princess and 3D modeling software to create a 3D rendered design of a toy car. The design would be a 1:1 ratio and use OnShape and Cura to design and print the model. The goal of the project was to create an accurate and to scale model of the car. </i></p>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Procedure:</h3>
<h4>DESIGN</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Select a toy car of your choice and make an engineering drawing on gridded paper with proper measurements in millimeters using a caliper</li>
  </ul>

<h4>MODEL</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Get familiar with the modeling software OnShape by navigating the program, learning to make sketches, use planes (xyz) and extrude</li>
  </ul>

<h4>FABRICATE</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Using the measurements prior, go through a multistep process to create the form of your car, extruding and adding designs on the x, y and z planes</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an envelope, add draw profiles, extrude big shapes, and add cosmetic details such as fillets, wheels, windows, and grilles </li>
  </ul>
    <li>Create a CAD drawing using OnShape to make a sketch of your car, add measurements and print it out </li>
    <li>Download Cura 4.8 and add supports to the 3D model and print!</li>
  </ul>

<h4>APPLICATION</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Compare the 3D printed car to the original toy car and identify the areas of error in size, shape, and overall aesthetic </li>
    <li>Take photos of the 3D print and the toy cars </li>
  </ul>


<h3>The Process:</h3>
<ul>
  This project was definitely the hardest one we’ve tackled so far this year. I was not familiar with 3D modeling softwares and was even nervous about starting to learn how to use them. Luckily, I wasn’t alone and dedicated a lot of time to getting to know the software, making it easier for me to fabricate my car. The hardest part of this project was the primary steps. I didn’t fully see how my toy car was going to translate over into a 3D software and had a difficult time creating my engineering drawing. If I were to do this project again, I would have spent more time understanding how the engineering drawing helps and made more detailed and accurate renditions of my car. The modeling process itself was relatively easy. I like OnShape because I got to go through many steps of extrusion and adding cosmetic details and the program would follow along, giving a timeline of my edits and changes to the document. Though I needed to backtrack a few times as well a go off track to get the look I wanted, I am more than happy with the final product and think I did a really good job stepping out of my comfort zone with this project. I would definitely do this project again and set even higher goals.</p>
